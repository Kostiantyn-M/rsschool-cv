### ABOUT ME

I am 26 years old and until recently I worked as a lawyer. So far, I have no experience in IT, but my 4 + experience in law taught me to carry out a large number of tasks and respond to new challenges. I am quite hardworking and attentive to details. I'm flexible, quick to capable to obtain the new skills and eager to learn from others. The specific of working in jurisprudence implies constant research and analysis, so I have honed my search and analytical skills well. I have already understood the fundamental importance of teamwork as collaboration and communication are essential to the successful execution of legal projects. I want to work in a company, where I can engage in serious and interesting work in big projects, in a company, where there are real career's development opportunities.
